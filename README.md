GPSPHOTO Tracker can synchronize a GPS tracklog data (GPX) with the timestamps from the image Exif metadata of digital photos to locate the position where the photos were taken, and visualizes the route with photos in Google Map. This tool can write GPS Exif metadata, for example, latidude, longitude, altitude and other requested additional metadata into the JPEG TIFF Photo. And more, it can track the GPX route and the GPSPhotos seprately, supporting KML and GML XML document outputting.
